# ClimateLife
We aim to foster a closer interaction paleoclimate and paleoecology (which is awesome).

This entails:
- Taking a record from the [LinkedEarth Wiki](http://wiki.linked.earth/) and ingesting it into R
- taking a Neotoma record and turning it into LiPD
- uploading that record to the [LinkedEarth Wiki](http://wiki.linked.earth/)  (note: this will work as soon as Varun fixes that capability)
- taking a LiPD-structured dataset and uploading it to Neotoma
